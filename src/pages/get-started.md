StoryTracker isn't ready for launch yet! It's almost there though! 

If you're interested, please [contact me](https://oliverhewitt.co.uk/contact/) to express interest!

I'd also love to know how you'd prefer to pay for it:

1. A lifetime license, where you then host it on your own server/infrastructure.
2. A yearly subscription, where the hosting is then managed by me (though bear in mind I'm still at school, so there won't be instantaneous support!)


Please feel free to get in touch!
