StoryTracker is ready to join your school! It's still a new product, so please bear with me while I iron out some of the bugs.

If you're interested, please [contact me](https://oliverhewitt.co.uk/contact/) to express interest!

Currently, I'm offering two options for how to pay for it. Please consider which of the following would work best for you:

1. A lifetime license, where you then host it on your own server/infrastructure. Bear in mind the amount of support I can offer with this option will be limited!
2. A yearly subscription, where the hosting is then managed by me.


Looking forward to hearing from you!
