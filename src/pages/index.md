## StoryTracker

Helping children read more at schools!

A good book has the power to inspire, educate, and transform young minds. 
The National Literacy Trust recently published their yearly report into how young people read. This showed that, in the last year alone, the number of young people who say that they read for pleasure has declined by 8.8%. 
Getting children reading is so important, but sometimes it can be easier said than done!
StoryTracker is a digital reading record, designed to make reading more engaging and organised for students while providing teachers with the tools they need to foster a love for literature.
