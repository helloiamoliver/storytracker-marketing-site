New books can quickly be added using the built-in search feature, and there are a whole host of other features to help them find their love for reading! The site is entirely responsive, so works just as well on mobile for when young people are on the go!

## Staff interface

As their teacher, it's really important for you to be able to keep an eye with how your students are getting on with reading.
